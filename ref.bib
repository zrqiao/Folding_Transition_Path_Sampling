abstract = {A central goal of protein-folding theory is to predict the stochastic dynamics of transition paths --- the rare trajectories that transit between the folded and unfolded ensembles --- using only thermodynamic information, such as a low-dimensional equilibrium free-energy landscape. However, commonly used one-dimensional landscapes typically fall short of this aim, because an empirical coordinate-dependent diffusion coefficient has to be fit to transition-path trajectory data in order to reproduce the transition-path dynamics. We show that an alternative, first-principles free-energy landscape predicts transition-path statistics that agree well with simulations and single-molecule experiments without requiring dynamical data as an input. This 'topological configuration' model assumes that distinct, native-like substructures assemble on a timescale that is slower than native-contact formation but faster than the folding of the entire protein. Using only equilibrium simulation data to determine the free energies of these coarse-grained intermediate states, we predict a broad distribution of transition-path transit times that agrees well with the transition-path durations observed in simulations. We further show that both the distribution of finite-time displacements on a one-dimensional order parameter and the ensemble of transition-path trajectories generated by the model are consistent with the simulated transition paths. These results indicate that a landscape based on transient folding intermediates, which are often hidden by one-dimensional projections, can form the basis of a predictive model of protein-folding transition-path dynamics.},

abstract = {Motivated by recent experimental efforts to measure the time a molecular system spends in transit between the reactants and the products of a chemical reaction, here we study the properties of the distribution of such transit times for the case of conservative dynamics on a multidimensional energy landscape. Unlike reaction rates, transit times are not invariant with respect to the order parameter (a.k.a. the experimental signal) used to monitor the progress of a chemical reaction. Nevertheless, such order parameter dependence turns out to be relatively weak. Moreover, for several model systems we find that the probability distribution of transit times can be estimated analytically, with reasonable accuracy, by assuming that the order parameter coincides with the direction of the unstable normal mode at the transition state. Although this approximation tends to overestimate the actual mean transit time measured using other order parameters, it yields asymptotically correct long-time behavior of the transi...},

abstract = {The framework of transition path theory (TPT) is developed in the context of continuous-time Markov chains on discrete state-spaces. Under assumption of ergodicity, TPT singles out any two subsets in the state-space and analyzes the statistical properties of the associated reactive trajectories, i.e., those trajectories by which the random walker transits from one subset to another. TPT gives properties such as the probability distribution of the reactive trajectories, their probability current and flux, and their rate of occurrence and the dominant reaction pathways. In this paper the framework of TPT for Markov chains is developed in detail, and the relation of the theory to electric resistor network theory and data analysis tools such as Laplacian eigenmaps and diffusion maps is discussed as well. Various algorithms for the numerical calculation of the various objects in TPT are also introduced. Finally, the theory and the algorithms are illustrated in several examples. 1. Introduction. Continuous-time Markov chains on discrete state-spaces have an enormous range of applications. In recent years, especially, with the explosion of new applications in network science, Markov chains have become the tool of choice not only to model the dynamics on these networks but also to study their topolog-ical properties [2, 26]. In this context, there is a need for new methods to analyze Markov chains on large state-spaces with no specific symmetries, as is relevant for large complex networks. This paper proposes one such method. A natural starting point to analyze a Markov chain is to use spectral analysis. This is especially relevant when the chain displays metastability, as was shown in [8, 12] in the context of time-reversible chains. By definition, the generator of a metastable chain possesses one or more clusters of eigenvalues near zero, and the associated eigenvectors provide a natural way to partition the chain (and hence the underlying network) into cluster of nodes on which the random walker remains for a very long time before finding its way to another such cluster. This approach has been used not only in the context of Markov chains arising from statistical physics (such as glassy systems [4, 7] or biomolecules [30]) but also in the context of data segmentation and embedding [32, 23, 29, 3, 14, 11, 21]. The problem with the spectral approach, however, is that not all Markov chains of interest are time-reversible and metastable, and, when they are not, the meaning of the first few eigenvectors of the generator is less clear. In this paper, we take another approach which does not require metastability},

abstract = {Recent advances in simulation and experiment have led to dramatic increases in the quantity and complexity of produced data, which makes the development of automated analysis tools very important. A powerful approach to analyze dynamics contained in such data sets is to describe/approximate it by diffusion on a free energy landscape-free energy as a function of reaction coordinates (RC). For the description to be quantitatively accurate, RCs should be chosen in an optimal way. Recent theoretical results show that such an optimal RC exists; however, determining it for practical systems is a very difficult unsolved problem. Here we describe a solution to this problem. We describe an adaptive nonparametric approach to accurately determine the optimal RC (the committor) for an equilibrium trajectory of a realistic system. In contrast to alternative approaches, which require a functional form with many parameters to approximate an RC and thus extensive expertise with the system, the suggested approach is nonparametric and can approximate any RC with high accuracy without system specific information. To avoid overfitting for a realistically sampled system, the approach performs RC optimization in an adaptive manner by focusing optimization on less optimized spatiotemporal regions of the RC. The power of the approach is illustrated on a long equilibrium atomistic folding simulation of HP35 protein. We have determined the optimal folding RC-the committor, which was confirmed by passing a stringent committor validation test. It allowed us to determine a first quantitatively accurate protein folding free energy landscape. We have confirmed the recent theoretical results that diffusion on such a free energy profile can be used to compute exactly the equilibrium flux, the mean first passage times, and the mean transition path times between any two points on the profile. We have shown that the mean squared displacement along the optimal RC grows linear with time as for simple diffusion. The free energy profile allowed us to obtain a direct rigorous estimate of the pre-exponential factor for the folding dynamics.},
