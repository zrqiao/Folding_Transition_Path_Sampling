\section{One-dimensional free energy landscape}

To evaluate transiton path statistics for free energy landscapes with multi intermediate barriers,
 following toy landscapes were constructed(Figure \ref{fig:FEL}). Free energy difference between source/sink and barrier top is $5.37kT$.

\section{Transition-path transit time distribution}

Ultilizing Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation for above-mentioned 1-d discrete states model, we sampled 10000
 transition-path trajectories and calculated distribution of transiton-path transit times $p(t_{AB})$ for each model landscapes.

  \label{fig:tpt_time}
\end{figure}

For each transit time distribution, the apparent force constant of the barrier $\omega$ was determined by fitting the decay constant $\omega^{-1}$ of the asymptotic exponential tail($p(t_{AB}>1.5)$); barrier height $\Delta F$ was
 then determined by fitting theoretial expression of $p(t_{AB})$ to simulation distribution of transit times. We demonstrated that even for the harmonic landscape, deviation from theoretial expression for parabolic barrier crossing is
 non-negligible; for multi-harmonic barriers model, significant deviation from theoretical distribution was observed,resulting in much smaller and relatively unphysical fitting result for barrier height $\Delta F$.

We also calculated the probability density $P(TP|x)$ that an arbitrary trajectory crossing state $x$ is a transiton path trajectory;

\section{Finite time displacement distribution}

In order to examine when the one-dimensional coordinate projection could be recognized as effective reaction coordinate,
we then examine the probability distribution of committors for transition path trajectories $p(q|TP)$, for which a single peak of probability $p(q|TP)$ have been ultilized as a indicator for 'good' reaction coordinates.
 Firstly, We found that for harmonic toy model, the shape of $p(q|TP)$ is very sensitive to the definition of source/sink region. For illustration, $p(q|TP)$ for two different selection
  of source/sink regions was compared: in the first case, only two free energy minimum was indentified as source or sink\textbf{(S1)}; in the second case, only the barrier top was
  defined as the transition path, while other two region of the free energy landscape was calssified as source/sink\textbf{(S2)}.
